The **Blox Fruits Stat Calculator** is an essential tool to maximize your potential in the game. In this post, we‚Äôll explain how the stat calculator works and how you can use it to plan your stat distribution.

The Stat Calculator allows you to input your current level and calculate the number of stat points you should allocate to different stats. The main stats are: **Melee**, **Defense**, **Sword**, **Gun**, and **Fruit**. Depending on your playstyle, you can allocate points to these stats for increased effectiveness in combat.

### How the Stat Calculator Works
The Stat Calculator is straightforward to use. Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **Input Your Current Level**: The first step is to input your current level in the **Stat Calculator**. This will determine how many stat points you have available for distribution.

2. **Allocate Stat Points**: Once you enter your level, the calculator will show you how many stat points you can allocate. You can then decide how to distribute those points among the different stats.

3. **Plan for Your Build**: Depending on your combat style, you can allocate points to **Melee**, **Fruit**, **Sword**, or **Gun**. For example, if you prefer using **Melee**, focus on the **Melee** stat for better damage output. If you're using **Fruit-based abilities**, allocate points to **Fruit** to increase your fruit damage.

4. **Defense**: **Defense** is crucial for surviving tougher enemies and bosses. If you're planning to farm tough mobs or fight high-level bosses, consider allocating some stat points into **Defense** to boost your survivability.

### The Best Stat Distribution
Here are some general guidelines for distributing your stat points:

- **Fruit Main**: If you're using **fruit-based abilities** (such as **Venom**, **Light**, **Magma**, or **Dragon**), focus primarily on **Fruit** and **Defense** to maximize your damage and survivability.
- **Melee Main**: If you're focusing on **Melee** combat, allocate most of your points into **Melee**, with a bit of **Defense** to ensure you can take hits during fights.
- **Sword Main**: Similar to Melee, but with **Sword** abilities, allocate points to **Sword** and **Defense** to become a strong sword fighter.
- **Hybrid**: A hybrid build focuses on both **Melee** and **Fruit**. You‚Äôll want to balance the points between **Melee** and **Fruit**, but still invest in **Defense** for extra durability.

### Why Use the Stat Calculator?
The **Stat Calculator** is a game-changer when it comes to planning your character's growth. It saves you time and allows you to avoid wasteful stat point distribution. Instead of blindly allocating stat points, the calculator lets you make informed decisions about your build and ensures you‚Äôre maximizing your potential for whatever combat style you prefer.

By planning your stats effectively, you‚Äôll have a stronger, more efficient character that‚Äôs ready to take on any challenge Blox Fruits has to offer.

### Conclusion
The **Blox Fruits Stat Calculator** is a must-have tool for any serious player. It helps you optimize your stat distribution, whether you‚Äôre focusing on **Fruit**, **Melee**, **Sword**, or **Gun**. Don‚Äôt waste your stat points ‚Äì use the calculator to create a build that suits your playstyle and take your Blox Fruits experience to the next level.
